*This is a submission for the [Bright Data Web Scraping Challenge](https://dev.to/challenges/brightdata): Scrape Data from Complex, Interactive Websites*

## What I Built

I created **Yoda’s EU Grant Finder for Solopreneurs**, a curated dataset (and minimal front-end demo) that pulls relevant EU funding opportunities specifically tailored to solo entrepreneurs and microbusinesses. 

- **Core Value**: It’s tough for small innovators to find relevant grants amidst vast, complex EU portals. This tool scrapes key information — titles, deadlines, eligibility criteria, funding amounts, and official links — and serves it in a clean, easy-to-download CSV (and JSON) format.  
- **MVP Scope**: Focuses on a handful of tech-oriented and innovation-focused EU grants. Demonstrates proof-of-concept with potential to expand into a fully-fledged, AI-driven recommendation platform.

## Demo

You can see a few screenshots of the working prototype below (from my local dev environment). More on [Github](https://github.com/PastSmartLink/Yoda-for-AI-Pipelines)
It includes a basic UI where users can:

- Filter grants by industry (e.g., AI, Urban Innovation, etc.).  
- Search by keyword (e.g., “research,” “green tech,” “blockchain”).  
- View an interactive bar chart of *approximate* funding values.  
- Download the data as CSV with a single click.

## How I Used Bright Data

### The Challenge
EU funding portals (like the [Funding & Tenders Portal](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/home) or [CORDIS](https://cordis.europa.eu/)) are laden with complex pagination, filter options, and dynamic elements. Building a custom scraper often requires:

- Handling JavaScript-driven pagination.  
- Navigating multi-step search forms.  
- Parsing unstructured text spread across multiple iframes or tables.  

### The Solution
1. **Bright Data’s Web Scraper**  
   - I used Bright Data to efficiently handle dynamic content. Their built-in flow for rotating proxies helped avoid potential IP blocks and ensure uninterrupted data extraction.

2. **Automated Scheduling & Pagination**  
   - By combining Bright Data’s capabilities with my Node.js scripts, I iterated through multiple pages (often behind session tokens).  

3. **Data Cleaning & Normalization**  
   - Titles, deadlines, and funding amounts often appeared in varying formats. I wrote a small pipeline to standardize them (e.g., turning `31-12-2023` into `2023-12-31`).  
   - Where official data was missing or in progress, I labeled it as `N/A`.

4. **Accessibility**  
   - Once scraped, the data was saved into both CSV and JSON formats for maximum reuse potential.  
   - The front-end interface (using plain JavaScript / chart libraries) references these files, offering a quick snapshot of which grants might be relevant.

### Why It Fits Prompt #1
- My primary deliverable is **a brand-new, solopreneur-focused dataset** — something that doesn’t currently exist in a single, easily downloadable location.  
- It demonstrates Bright Data’s robust scraping capabilities to build a meaningful resource for an underserved audience.

#### (Qualifying for Other Prompts Too?)
- **Prompt #2**: I provide a minimal front-end with an interactive chart. A future expansion could deepen these insights (like advanced analytics or AI recommendations).  
- **Prompt #3**: My scraping overcame complex, dynamic pages with multiple filtering options — but the dataset creation (Prompt #1) remains the central focus.

## Technical Highlights

- **Front-End**: A lightweight React/Vanilla JS interface (run via `npx live-server`) that visualizes the data in bar charts and searchable tables.  
- **Back-End**: Node.js scripts for scraping (run via `npm run dev`), leveraging Bright Data to handle concurrency, proxies, and session-based pages.  
- **Data Visualization**: Simple charting library (Chart.js or D3) for dynamic bar graphs.  
- **Branding**: Yoda-themed design and microcopy for a fun, memorable user experience.  

> **Future Plans**  
> - **AI Integration**: Tying this data into my “Yoda AI Pipeline” for personalized grant recommendations.  
> - **Expanding Sources**: Adding more EU programs (Horizon Europe, Startup Europe) plus local government grants.  
> - **Commercialization**: Offering deeper data analysis or specialized filtering for a subscription fee or via one-time dataset purchases.

## Conclusion

**Yoda’s EU Grant Finder for Solopreneurs** aims to simplify the journey for small innovators who are typically overlooked. By leveraging Bright Data’s web scraping capabilities, we’ve transformed fragmented, hard-to-find data into a concise dataset — the perfect launchpad for future AI pipelines, real-time updates, and commercial data sharing.

[Frontend showcase](https://github.com/PastSmartLink/frontend-showcase)

In the mid-2000s, it was clear that Europe’s next wave of innovation would involve **data-driven insights** and community-focused solutions. Today, this vision is stronger than ever: entrepreneurs across the EU use powerful tools like **web scraping** and **machine learning** to tackle societal challenges.

A big part of this shift is the **increased accessibility of public data**, supported by initiatives like the [**Bright Initiative**](https://brightinitiative.com/). Through community engagement, education, and philanthropy, programs like this ensure that data technology serves not just large organizations but also **small businesses and solopreneurs**.

My project, **Yoda’s EU Grant Finder for Solopreneurs**, aligns with this vision. It scrapes and consolidates EU funding info so even **micro-entrepreneurs** can spot and apply for relevant grants—leveling the playing field by giving them equal access to critical resources.

When data is open and responsibly used, **every** innovator has a shot at turning big ideas into real impact. By uniting tech, open data, and social responsibility, we’re shaping a more inclusive, forward-thinking Europe—one grant at a time.
